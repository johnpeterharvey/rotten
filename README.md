Fetch movie info from rotten tomatoes, reverting to imdb. Output to the movie directory as an xml information file.

Still far from complete.

You will need a Rotten Tomatoes API key, which can be obtained from
[Rotten Tomatoes Developers](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com). An
example config file is included in the project.
